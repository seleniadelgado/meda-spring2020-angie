It’s a concept not many women are familiar with because we do not only face scrutiny for it but also a lot of dangers. However, it is one of the most freeing and fulfilling experiences. If you are an introvert like me, yet enjoy the feeling of being somewhere you’ve never been before where no one knows you and you don’t know anyone then I recommend taking up solo traveling. I got into it because no one ever wanted to travel. I felt that I was pushing dates further and further out because I was always waiting for someone to join me. Turns out, I was missing out on precious time I could have spent planning and best of all travelling and meeting new people and learning of new cultures worse yet, I was missing out on a lot of foreign foods. So I took up the courage and moved to Argentina.</p>

            <h2>My seven steps for solo travel research:</h2>

                <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <h5>Before traveling to any country, I advise you to do some research. What do you feel like doing? Do you want mountains, beach, city? Are you looking for history? Are you trying to relax? Are you trying to party all night? This will help you narrow down the places you want to see. More importantly choose what climate you will prefer to spend your time in.</h5>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <h5>Once you are at this point start with step two which is to research the place’s political and health climate. Are there protests, elections, war? These are very good reasons not to travel somewhere. Do not be a burden and do not get yourself killed. Of course, anything can happen while you are there, but best to be prepared. Healthwise, is there a virus you do not want to be infected by? Can you get a shot before going that will help you, for example in case of yellow fever in Colombia, you can get a shot before traveling there, but for coronavirus there does not seem to be a cure just yet, so maybe hold off on going to China for a bit. </h5>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <h5>Learn about their customs. You may find yourself desperate to get out of a place because you do not enjoy their culture and that is okay. We are all human and have preferences and opinions. Before you do something that will get you in trouble or cause for you to be disrespectful, it is best to research and learn what to expect. You do not have to like every place you visit. 
                    </h5>

                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <h5>Learn about transportation within the country. How do locals get around? Is Uber allowed in the country or is there something like Uber? Are you planning to rent a car? This will also come in handy when you begin to think about accomodations and distance between the places you want to visit</h5>
                <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <h5>Learn about traditional dishes. What are the typical foods? Are you vegetarian trying to visit Argentina? (Like me) Diet should not be a reason not to go, but it is good to be mentally prepared of what is available? 
                    </h5>
                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                    <h5> Learn a few phrases in their language or languages. You will be greatful to know some basics like "where is the bathroom", among other helpful words. Not only will you benefit from it, but the people in these countries will appreciate your efforts. Do not forget to include a smile.
                    </h5>
                <h3>Step 7</h3>    
                    <h5> And last, but definitely not least, what is their currency value compared to yours? In Nicaragua, I felt like royalty. In Paris, that was a different story...</h5>

            <p>A lot of my advice comes from my own experience and having travelled to 15 different countries. As I have travelled, 
            I have also learned that I can not possibly make every mistake so I learn from other people's mistakes. Thank God for technology and access to 
            other people's experiences, I have learned from using pages like <a href="https://www.yelp.com">yelp</a>, <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com">tripadvisor</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a> to read reviews of accomodations and 
            restaurants before signing my money away. Another very important, if not the most important way I have learned so much about travel is through 
           Facebook groups, such as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/womenwhotraveltheworld/"> Women Who Travel</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/thesolofemaletravelernetwork/">The Solo Female Traveling Network</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/girlswhotravelgroup/">Girls who love travel</a>. I was blessed with being bilingual 
            so I also get a lot of tips from Spanish groups, my favorite these days is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/990087794478583/">Viajeros - Mochileros</a>. These pages are filled with tips, photos, and 
            best of all no matter how obscure your travel plans are, there's someone who has already done it and can give you insider scoop. These are people 
            from all over the world who share their love for travelling with the world. Some of my favorite instagrammers to follow are <a href="https://www.instagram.com/detantoandarviajes/?hl=en">@detantoandarviajes</a> an Argentine radio station for travelling, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/relatosenmochila/?hl=en"> @relatosenmochila</a>, and someone who I actually met in person and appreciate a lot for what he taught me about photography <a href="https://www.instagram.com/estebanmazzoncini/?hl=en">@estebanmazzoncini</a> who funds his travels with photos and by writing books of his experiences. Of course, my favorite instagram is my page and you can follow me at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/angieselenia/">@angieselenia</a>
